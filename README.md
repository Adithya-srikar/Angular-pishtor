# Project Setup Guide

This project consists of a **FastAPI** backend and an **Angular** frontend. Below are the detailed steps to set up and run both parts locally.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Backend Setup (FastAPI)**

### Step 1: Navigate to the Backend Directory
Open your terminal and navigate to the **backend** directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv {environment_name}
./{environment_name}/Scripts/activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv {environment_name}
source {environment_name}/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install all required dependencies. If you have a `requirements.txt` file in your **backend** folder, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests pydantic joblib
```

### Step 4: Run the FastAPI Backend Server
Start the FastAPI backend server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5005
```

Once the server is running, you should be able to access the FastAPI backend at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:5005
```

## üåê **Frontend Setup (Angular)**

### Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory
Open a new terminal window and navigate to your **Angular** project directory:

```bash
cd phistor
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all the required dependencies for the Angular application:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary node modules.

### Step 3: Run the Angular Development Server
Start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

The Angular application should now be running at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:4200
```

## üåê **Full Stack Integration**

Once both the **backend** (FastAPI) and **frontend** (Angular) are running, you can test your application by navigating to:

- **Backend URL**: `http://localhost:5005`
- **Frontend URL**: `http://localhost:4200`

Make sure both servers are running simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

## üîß **Troubleshooting Tips:**

### CORS Issue:
- If you encounter **CORS issues** between FastAPI and Angular, make sure **CORS middleware** is correctly set up in the FastAPI backend to allow requests from `http://localhost:4200`.
- Check that your **ng serve** URL matches the backend server‚Äôs URL.

### Angular/NPM Issues:
- If you face issues with **npm** or **node_modules**:
  - Try running `npm install` again in the **Angular** directory to refresh the node modules.
  - Ensure the **node version** matches the one specified for your project (if applicable).

---

## üìù **Notes:**

- The **backend** is built using **FastAPI** and runs on **Uvicorn** for development.
- The **frontend** is built with **Angular** and uses the default Angular development server (`ng serve`).
- Make sure both the **frontend** and **backend** servers are running simultaneously for full functionality.
